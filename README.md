SocialCCNSim
============

Description
-----------
SocialCCNSim is a discrete-event trace executor of a CCN network.

Features
--------
 * Simulator of a network of caches
 * Support SONETOR[0] traces
 * Supported Caching Strategies:
    * ProbCache [8]
    * Cache 'Less For More' [7]
    * Leave Copy Everywhere [6]
    * Leave Copy Down
    * MAGIC[5]
    * Rand Copy One
    * Most Popular Caching (MPC) [3]
    * Leave Copy on the Edge
 * Supported replacement policies:
    * Last Recently Used (LRU)
    * First-In First-Out (FIFO)
 * Supported Social Network topologies:
    * Facebook
    * LastFM
    * Every networkx graph can be used as topology, by placing it on the graphs folder.
 * Supported Network Topologies:
    * Abilene
    * GEANT
    * DTELECOM
    * Tiger
    * Tree
    * Diamond
    * Every networkx graph can be used as topology, by placing it on the graphs folder.
 * Implementation of Cache Hit, Stretch, Diversity and Cache Evictions metrics[1]
 * Supports mobility of the users
 * Plugins for new caching strategies
 * Plugins for every new replacement policy

Installation
------------

Typical Ubuntu installation:
```bash
> apt-get install python-networkx python-scipy python-numpy python-pyparsing
> git clone git://github.com/panisson/pymobility.git
> cd pymobility
> python setup.py install (run as admin/root)
> cd ..
```

Using virtualenv:
```bash
> virtualenv .
> source bin/activate
> easy_install networkx
> easy_install numpy
> easy_install scipy
> easy_install pyparsing
> easy_install pymobility
> git clone https://github.com/mesarpe/socialccnsim.git
> cd socialccnsim
```

Dependencies
------------
Networkx, scipy, numpy, pylru[2]

Examples
--------

Execute the trace test_trace in a CCN network with abilene as topology and Leave Copy Everywhere (LCE) as caching strategy.
LRU is used as replacement policy,
Links acquaintances among simulated users is represented with a graph of a Facebook social network.
```bash
> python -O socialccnsim.py -c 2 -s lce -u facebook -t abilene -p lru -f exampletrace/verysmall
```

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
Q. How do I change the cache size per node?

A. Set the first parameter (i.e. 2 in the example) to the desired cache size per node.

Q. How do I change the popularity properties of the trace?

A. Socialccnsim executes synthetic traces. If you want to create traces with special properties (special parameters), you are encouraged to give it a visit to SONETOR [https://github.com/mesarpe/sonetor]. SONETOR is a synthetic traces generator. With SONETOR, traces can be generated and then executed into Socialccnsim.
